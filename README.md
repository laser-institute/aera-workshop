## A LASER Focus on Understanding and Improving STEM Education

**Wednesday, August 11, 2021; 1:00pm–4:00pm**

**Recording:** <https://youtu.be/b5E_KyMTpnY>

### Overview

This workshop will introduce participants to Learning Analytics (LA), an emerging research and teaching field sitting at the intersection of Learning (e.g. educational technology, learning and assessment sciences), Analytics (e.g. visualization, computer/data sciences), and Human-Centered Design (e.g. usability, participatory design). LA is proving to be a powerful approach for understanding and improving the digital learning contexts highlighted in the national STEM education plan, while also examining persistent problems in STEM education from new angles.

The instructors will provide a brief overview of LA methodologies, literature, applications, and ethical issues as they relate to STEM education, with an emphasis on digital learning environments and broadening participation in STEM programs. Participants will be introduced to open-access curriculum materials developed as part of the [Learning Analytics in STEM Education Research (LASER) Institute](https://www.fi.ncsu.edu/projects/laser-institute/) to gain hands-on experience with computational analysis techniques (e.g. network analysis, text mining, machine learning) using R and RStudio.
