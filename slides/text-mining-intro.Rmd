# What is text mining? 

According to my graduate students...

Text mining **is**... 
- a process for gaining insight into large amounts of text
- an exploration of text in search of patterns 
- like computer-assisted reading
- magic

.pull-right[
Text mining **is not**... 
- a substitute for traditional qualitative analysis
- as "automated" as one would think
- unlike reading tea leaves
- magic

A central question in text mining is: 

## How do we **quantify** what a document is about?

# Basic Text Analysis

... it’s a mistake to imagine that text mining is now in a sort of crude infancy, whose real possibilities will only be revealed after NLP matures. **Wordcounts are amazing!**

- Text Preprocessing
- Word Counts
- Term Frequencies
- TF-IDF

# Dictionary-Based Methods

.pull-left[
Dictionary-based text analysis uses predefined list of words, or **lexicons**, to assign a particular meaning, value, or category to each word in you data:  

- Custom Dictionaries
- Stop Words
- Sentiment Lexicons
- Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)

```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
knitr::kable(sample_n(get_sentiments("bing"), 5))
```

# Topic Modeling

With a bit of tongue-in-cheek, [Meeks and Weingart](http://journalofdigitalhumanities.org/2-1/dh-contribution-to-topic-modeling/) describe topic modeling as:

>leveraging occult statistical methods like 'dirichlet priors' and 'bayesian models'... to provide seductive but obscure results in the form of easily interpreted (and manipulated) 'topics.'

```{r, echo=F, out.width='55%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('img/topic-model.png')
```

#  Text Mining Considerations

Despite the potential advantages of text-based data captured by educational technologies, **TM poses a number of challenges** for STEM Ed researchers.

# Applications in STEM Ed Research

.panelset[

.panel[.panel-name[Performance]
TM has been largely used to **evaluate academic  performance** in different contexts, especially to  essays and online assignments.

- writing style
- use of argumentation
- plagiarism detection
- peer interaction
]

.panel[.panel-name[Feedback]
To help improve performance, TM is used to  **provide student feedback**, often based on both their interactions and activities 

- Intelligent Tutoring Systems
- Question-answering applications
- Assist teacher  feedback
- Support formative feedback

]

.panel[.panel-name[Engagement]
TM has been applied to **support student engagement and collaboration**, especially in distance learning courses. 

- Automated writing scaffolds
- Analysis of interactional resources
- Student sentiment extraction
- Dropout prevention
]

.panel[.panel-name[Other Uses]
Other applications of text mining in STEM Ed Research include: 
- Automatic text summarization
- Analytics & visualization tools
- Curriculum adaptation
- Recommendation systems
