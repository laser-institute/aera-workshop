# Why should I care? 

There has been **unprecedented increase in text-based data ** generated by educational processes and digital learning systems, resulting in...

# What is text mining? 

According to my graduate students... 

--

.pull-left[
Text mining **is**... 
- a process for gaining insight into large amounts of text
- an exploration of text in search of patterns 
- like computer-assisted reading
- magic
]

--

.pull-right[
Text mining **is not**... 
- a substitute for traditional qualitative analysis
- as "automated" as one would think
- unlike reading tea leaves
- magic

A central question in text mining is: 

# How do we **quantify** what a document is about?

... it’s a mistake to imagine that text mining is now in a sort of crude infancy, whose real possibilities will only be revealed after NLP matures. **Wordcounts are amazing!**

- Word Counts
- Term Frequencies
- TF-IDF

# Dictionary-Based Methods

.pull-left[
Dictionary-based text analysis uses predefined list of words, or **lexicons**, to assign a particular meaning, value, or category to each word in you data:  

- Custom Dictionaries
- Stop Words
- Sentiment Lexicons
- Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC)
]
.pull-right[
Bing Lexicon Example: 
```{r, echo=F, message=FALSE}
library(tidytext)
library(dplyr)
library(DT)
knitr::kable(sample_n(get_sentiments("bing"), 5))
```

#  Text Mining Considerations

Despite the potential advantages of text-based data captured by educational technologies, they also create a range of challenges for STEM Ed researchers.
