# 1.1. Why use network anaylsis?

---

# Networks matter

## Personally

- _Choosing_ to interact with certain departmental colleagues expanded my network
- My friend Ryan Estrellado sharing about Ted Lasso _influenced_ me

## For young people

- Peers _impact_ young people (and students) directly and indirectly
- Older students _selecting_ particular students to reply to in a discussion forum 

## For educators

- More experienced colleagues _shape_ what teachers perceive to be effective
- New ideas about teaching _diffusing_ through social media

---

What are some aspects of networks that may matter to your own life&amp;mdash;and research and teaching?

---

# But, we often focus on individuals

- This is for good reason in STEM education research&amp;mdash;as individual educator and student characteristics matter
- But, there is often a great deal of unexplained variation in the things we care about, even when we account for _dependencies_ at the multiple levels at which educators and students are impacted

# Relationships matter

- One place to look is at the **interdependencies** among educators, students, and others
- In other words, relationships are another potential source of variation
  - They may also be a phenomenon of interest independent of how well they explain variation
- There is an extensive tradition of qualitative lines of inquiry on how interactions and relations matter and social network analyses may complement these analyses

&lt;h3&gt;Idea #1: Though we often focus on individuals (or the dependencies between individuals), social network analysis allows us to focus on relationships between individuals&lt;/h3&gt;

# 1.2. What is social network analysis?

---
# All about relationships

- We can think of network analysis as a collection of techniques for examining relationships which can take many different forms:
  - Face-to-face relationships between educators
  - Online relationships among students
--

- The data we use as input, too, can take different forms:
  - Self-reported relationships (e.g., [Coburn et al., 2012](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/667699), [Horn et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858420914898), and [Spillane et al. (2012)](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.3102/0002831212459339))
  - Relationships inferred from digital sources of data (e.g., [Chen and Huang, 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jcal.12355), [Hu et al., 2018](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C43&amp;q=pinterest+torphy&amp;btnG=), [Kellogg et al., 2014](https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/irrodl/1900-v1-n1-irrodl04945/1065545ar/abstract/), and [Staudt Willet &amp; Carpenter, 2020](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15391523.2020.1722978))

--

&lt;h3&gt;Idea #2: The kinds of relationships we investigate depend on our research questions&amp;mdash;prior research and theory can guide us&lt;/h3&gt;

---

# Not one method

- Moreover, the technique we can use to study these relationships take different forms:
  - *Visualizing networks* through network visualizations, or sociograms
  - *Describing networks* through the use of individual or network statistics
  - *Using network models* for key processes, such as selection and influence
- These methods go by many names:
  - Social network analysis (SNA)
  - Network analysis
  - Network science

--

&lt;h3&gt;Idea #3: Social network analysis is a collection of methods for visualizing, describing, and modeling social network data&amp;mdash; which technique(s) you choose depends on the claims you want to make&lt;/h3&gt;

What are some ways you could gather data on relationships?

# 1.3. What are common techniques used for social network analysis

---

# Collecting and Creating Data

- **Self-reported relationships**: Asking people about who they turn to for advice about teaching mathematics ([Horn et al., 2020](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2332858420914898))
  - The *nominator* refers to the person asked
  - The *nominees* refer to the people the nominator indicated they turn to for advice
  - What can we say about those who are the nominees of many people?

---

# Collecting and Creating Data

- **Inferred relationships from digital data**: Using digital social media data as records of who interacted with whom ([Rosenberg et al., 2020](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/tea.21660))
  - The *nominator* refers to the person who initiated&amp;mdash;or _sent_&amp;mdash;an interaction
  - The _nominee_ refers to the person who was the recipient of the interaction
  - What can we say about those who are the nominees of many people?

--

&lt;h3&gt;Idea #4: Relationships can be measured using self-reported and&amp;mdash;increasingly&amp;mdash;digital data sources&lt;/h3&gt;

---

# Analyzing data

- For analyzing social network data (self-reported or digital), R is open-source, free, and feature-rich, especially with respect to network analysis
  - [tidygraph](https://tidygraph.data-imaginist.com/) for creating graph "objects"
  - [ggraph](https://ggraph.data-imaginist.com/) for visualizing networks
  - the [statnet](https://statnet.org/) collection of packages for preparing and modeling data, including [ergm](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ergm/index.html)

What are your goals for analyzing social network data?

# 1.4. What are some of the technical and ethical considerations for social network analysis? 

---

# Technical considerations

- In most analyses, preparing data takes time; this is (perhaps especially) true of network for social network analyses
- Regardless of whether the data is self-reported or digital, a useful way to structure data is in terms of an **edgelist**
  - An edgelist contains two columns, one for the _nominator_ and one for the _nominee_
  - In most cases, both nominators and nominees appear many times in each of the two columns
  - Additionally, there may be other columns that represent information on the particular relationship
  
--

&lt;h3&gt;Idea #5: An edgelist is a key data structure that can position us to visualize, describe, and model social network data&lt;/h3&gt;

---

#  Ethical considerations

- When collecting self-report data, a high response rate is often important
  - To achieve this, building trust with experts working within schools and districts is often essential 
- Privacy can matter a great deal for social network data (self-reported _and_ digital)
  - Consider anonymizing individuals' names or do not include their names
- Follow Institutional Review Boards guidelines, but consider ethics beyond what IRBs mandate
  - Ask, _should I collect this data?_ What are the _risks_ and _potential benefits_?
  - Balance [open science and privacy](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11423-020-09860-8) is a challenge
  
---

How might ethical challenges intersect with your social network analysis research?
