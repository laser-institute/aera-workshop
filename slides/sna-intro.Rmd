# 1.1. Why network anaylsis?

---

# Networks matter

- We're often influenced by our networks
    - Joshâ€™s friend Ryan Estrellado sharing about Ted Lasso on Slack
    - Bret caring about ethical issues in social media research
    - Seeing how colleagues negotiate speaking up in a department meeting
    - TikTok dance competitions
- Or, in a multi-level context, how factors at other levels, like teacher practice, matter
- But, our research often examines individuals and their characteristics and antecedents (READ FRANK 1998)
- Network analysis treats the relationships between people as a phenomenon of central interest

# 1.2. What is network analysis exactly?

---

# Network analysis is about relationships

- We can think of network analysis as a broad range of tools for examining relationships but it's helpful to be concrete
    - visualizing networks through sociograms
    - describing networks through the use of individual or network statistics
    - using network models for key processes, such as selection and influence

# 1.3. What are common techniques used for quantifying text? 

---

# Collecting and Creating Data

- asking people about who they relate with (ref the AERA Open piece, ref the SITE piece)
- studying networks through traces (bodong, JRST)
- for visualizing networks, R is great and open-source and free
    - tidygraph and ggraph are great for these purposes (find example?)

---

# Describing Networks

- for describing networks, using descriptive stats can get one far (coburn paper)

---

# Modeling Networks

- for selection and influence, we have many options
    - selection
        - logistic regression
        - p2 MLM selection model
        - latent space selection
        - ergm selection model
    - influence
        - regression
        - multi-level
        - latent space

# 1.4. What are some of the technical and ethical considerations of text mining? 

---

#  Ethics Matter

- ensuring a high response rate when using self-report - building trust with schools/a network
- privacy/sensitivity - not depicting individuals' names in networks
- sharing data / balancing open science and privacy
- going beyond IRB with respect to using digital traces

# 1.5. How is text mining used in STEM education research?

---

# Applications in STEM Ed Research

- visualization: XXX

---

# Applications in STEM Ed Research

- descriptive: coburn piece, SITE piece

---

# Applications in STEM Ed Research

- selection and influence: AERA Open piece, JRST piece, bodong piece
