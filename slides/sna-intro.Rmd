# Basic Text Analysis

... itâ€™s a mistake to imagine that text mining is now in a sort of crude infancy, whose real possibilities will only be revealed after NLP matures. **Wordcounts are amazing!**

- Text Preprocessing
- Word Counts
- Term Frequencies
- TF-IDF

#  Text Mining Considerations

Despite the potential advantages of text-based data captured by educational technologies, they also create a range of challenges for STEM Ed researchers.
